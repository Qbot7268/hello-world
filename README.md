# hello-world
Qbot7268 is my username, and I don't know if I'm supposed to be here.
I made a Github account for a different reason...
This 2021, Classic Sonic fans are having special treats this year...
One of these treats is related to the Sonic 1/2 (2013) on Android and iOS.
On the 20th of January, 2021 (GMT+8), the two games were decompiled and are now playable on PC.
A beta was released to some people, and I wanted to test it.
Unfortunately, I had to make a Github account to access the artifacts.
This is where I am now; I don't know if I'll actually use Github, but this IS a start.
